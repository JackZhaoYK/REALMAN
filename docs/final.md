## Project Summary

In the modern world, people use autonomous robots to do some work. Autonomous vacuum robots today commonly exist in many homes, it uses sensors for obstacle detection, a new feature of cliff detection has been used as an additional sensing technology for safety. Under the development of technology, we believe that auto vacuum robots should have the ability to detect cliff and down the stairs safely. Our project is a downhill survival game in Minecraft, which asks the agent to go down the map as many levels as possible within limited steps. The agent is able to look down five floors in order to determine the next step. Once the player reaches the bottom of the map, the map will be regenerated. Rewards are given for each level the player goes down, and penalties are applied for touching the map boundary and dropping more than five levels at a time. The agent is expected to have higher rewards for optimization (considered to be a combination of less falling damages and fewer steps).
