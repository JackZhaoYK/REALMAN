##Summary of the Project

Our project will be a downhill survival game AI for Minecraft. Our scenario will begin with the agent at the 100th floor. The goal will be to keep agent alive and navigate down to the first floor. The agent would choose the best way to navigate down with minimum damage based on the observation. The potential application would be the danger alert system for robots, any type of cars, etc.
